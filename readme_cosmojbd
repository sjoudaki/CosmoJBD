CODE:

We provide a set of updated modules and associated data files in EFTCAMB and CosmoMC for
constraining Jordan-Brans-Dicke (JBD) gravity.

The linear perturbations for JBD gravity are included by modifying the files in the camb
directory, such as equations_EFT.f90, EFT_main.f90, and EFT_functions.f90. The nonlinear
corrections to the Weyl and matter power spectra are obtained by calibrating
HMCODE (camb/halofit_ppf.f90) to a hybrid suite of COLA and RAMSES N-body simulations
in a JBD Universe.

Most of the observables require only minor additional modifications to the code (such as the
growth rate in bao.f90). The file "source/CosmoJBD.f90" calculates the 3x2pt likelihood for
the KiDS, 2dFLenS, and BOSS datasets in a JBD cosmology. This includes the 2pt shear correlation
functions \xi_+ and \xi_-, the galaxy-galaxy lensing angular cross-correlation \gamma_t, and the
redshift-space multipole power spectra P_0 and P_2. The analysis pipeline allows for a higher
density of ell-modes via "use_morell", and it allows for Romberg vs trapezoidal integration via
"use_rombint" (where trapezoidal is much faster). These settings can be modified in
data/CosmoJBD.dataset. 

The 3x2pt code accounts for key systematic uncertainties associated with the intrinsic galaxy
alignments, baryonic feedback (via HMCODE in camb/halofit_ppf.f90), photometric redshifts,
shear calibration, galaxy bias, pairwise velocity dispersion, and shot noise. The intrinsic
alignment amplitude is given by "ampia" and its redshift dependence is given by "redzia".
The code also allows for a luminosity dependence "lumia". The priors on these parameters are
set in batch2/kids2dflens.ini. The baryonic feedback amplitude is given by "baryfeed".
The prior on this parameter is set in batch1/params_CMB_defaults_jbd.ini. 

The photometric redshift uncertainties are accounted for by looping over the DIR bootstrap 
realizations of the tomographic redshift distributions (see Hildebrandt et al 2017, 
arXiv:1606.05338). The approach is set up in an example job submission script testjbd.sh.
For each new run, the user needs to reset "samples = 0" in batch1/common_batch1_jbd.ini.
For simpler runs where the photo-z uncertainties are not accounted for, one can enable 
use_bootstrapnz = F where the mean redshift distributions are used instead.


MEASUREMENTS:

The measurements, covariances, redshift distributions, and masking files are provided
in data/lensingrsdfiles/.

Both 2dFLenS and BOSS are restricted to the overlapping areas with KiDS-450, and divided into 
`low-redshift' and `high-redshift' galaxy samples, covering $0.15 < z < 0.43$ (2dFLOZ, LOWZ) 
and $0.43 < z < 0.70$ (2dFHIZ, CMASS). 

The files "bootstrapnz/nz_zi_kids_bootj.dat" contain the redshift distributions for 
each tomographic bin i and bootstrap realization j, with format z n(z), where i runs 
from 1 to 4 and j runs from 0 to 999.

The full BOSS DR12 measurements and inverse covariance matrix of the Alcock-Paczynski
effect, growth rate, and BAO distances are provided in data/sdss_BAO_RSD_DR12_meas.txt
and data/sdss_BAO_RSD_DR12_invcov.txt thanks to Shadab Alam. The corresponding ini file
is given by batch2/BAO_RSD_DR12.ini.
